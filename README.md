# Entering Practical Exam for the Decision Sciences Research Center at Tecnologico de Monterrey
 
## Overview

This project aims to solve the exam propo using data from the World Bank. The analysis is carried out using a Jupyter Notebook, which contains the code, visualizations, and explanations related to each task.

## Files

- **`requirements.txt`**: Contains a list of Python packages required to run the Jupyter Notebook. Use this file to set up your environment with all necessary dependencies.
- **`analysis_notebook.ipynb`**: A Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis, code, and visualizations. This notebook provides a step-by-step exploration of the data and findings.

## Getting Started
