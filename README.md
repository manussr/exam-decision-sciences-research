# Entering Practical Exam for the Decision Sciences Research Center at Tecnologico de Monterrey
 
## Overview

This is my submission for the Practical Exam at the Decision Sciences Research Center, Tecnol√≥gico de Monterrey. For each task, you will find a folder that includes the following:

* The script used for the analysis
* Any necessary data files
* A markdown file summarizing the results

Please refer to the instructions provided below, which apply to each task.

## Files

- **`requirements.txt`**: Contains a list of Python packages required to run the Jupyter Notebook. Use this file to set up your environment with all necessary dependencies.
- **`question-n.ipynb`**: A Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis, code, and visualizations. This notebook provides a step-by-step exploration of the data and findings.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python and pip installed on your machine. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone [repository_url]
   cd [repository_directory]

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**

   ```bash
    python -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`


3. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt

### Running the scripts

1. **Start Jupyter Notebook:**:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook

2. **Open the notebook:**

    In your browser, navigate to the Jupyter interface and open the corresponding notebook (eg., question-1.ipynb).


3. **Execute cells:**

   Run each cell in the notebook to perform the analysis and view the results.


### Results

For each task, there is a separate Markdown file that provides a summary and explanation of the results.
