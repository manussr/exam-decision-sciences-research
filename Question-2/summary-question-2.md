# Question 2: Predictive Modeling and Scenario Analysis

Task:
Develop a predictive model to forecast CO2 emissions based on the comprehensive set of
indicators. Use the model to answer an analytical question: “If a country increases its GDP
by 10%, what is the expected percentage change in CO2 emissions, assuming all other
factors remain constant?”
